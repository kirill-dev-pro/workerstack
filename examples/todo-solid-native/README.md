# todo-solid-native

A Solid 2 example using Workerstack without TanStack Query, code generation, or
a local network layer. `createClient<App>()` infers the native oRPC graph from
the server app type; the Solid adapter mirrors confirmed live-view snapshots
into a keyed store, while Solid actions own the optimistic overlay.

- `src/workerstack.ts` — backend plus the exported `App` type handle.
- `src/native/todos.ts` — the entire app data layer: one `LiveView` and three
  optimistic actions.
- `src/TodoList.tsx` — UI and mutation-scoped error presentation.
- `src/native/form.ts` — draft recovery that preserves newer edits and submissions.

The database generates canonical Todo IDs. `workerstack/client` generates an
internal `operationId` for each mutation, sends it as a request header, and
waits for the matching live frame before allowing Solid to discard the
optimistic overlay. A temporary `pending:*` value is only a local render key.

Bounded views remain correct because the server emits a fresh keyed snapshot
after relevant changes when `limit` is present.

Better Auth is served by the same `app.handler` under `/api/auth/*`, but is
deliberately consumed through Better Auth's own Solid client when an app needs
authentication. It is not part of the oRPC graph.

The app is an SPA on the Workers runtime. `src/worker.ts` is the Worker, and
the frontend is static assets from `dist/client`.

```sh
bun run test
bun run dev     # sqld, celld with the Worker, and Vite; one command
bun run build   # dist/client, and a check of wrangler.json
```

The first `bun run dev` downloads celld and sqld to `~/.cache/workerstack`.
Deploy with `wrangler deploy` (Cloudflare) or `celld deploy` (your server).

New optimistic rows have disabled checkbox/delete controls until the server ID
arrives. The actions also ignore temporary IDs. A rejected add restores its title
only if the user has neither edited the input nor submitted another todo.

Row pending is an optimistic affordance: the installed Solid 2 runtime does not
mark optimistic writes themselves as pending reads. LiveView continues to own
connection status and operation acknowledgement.
